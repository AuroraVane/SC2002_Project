Code structure:
    Slot contains Outcome Record for that slot
    Medical Record is seperate (tho i considered if Slot with completed outcome record shld be directly converted into medical record, but seems ambiguous)
    
    Database basically contains some very basic but useful methods to use on hashtables and lists
    Database has no attributes

    other databases will inherit from Database class and use its methods
    child database classes contain methods that manipulate their respective attribute hashtable/lists

    In the case of appointment, theres 3 levels of database, because appointment database class will contain methods that both doctor and patients use,
    last layer of class defines the methods more clealy towards the respective menus's functionalities for doctor and patient

    Might consider doing the same too for Medical Record database when we combine everyth together later on

Design Assumptions:
    When a doctor DECLINE an appointment, i will not return it to the availability list, because i assume the doctor cancelled it because
    he's busy or sth and changed his mind

    Assume doctors can only add on to textfiles and cannot remove or directly edit anyth
    (tbh shld just open the txt file for them to edit ahh, damn stupid istg one smh)

    we also assume the entire project is autonomous, especailly when people are trying to edit the same file at the same time
    -we assume no 2 people will be editting simultaneously
    

Design Considerations:
    Appointment Outcome: outcome records are recorded as part of Slot class, because when an appointment ends, they automatically have to record the outcome

    I know its not possible for this project, but maintaining data consistency and synchronisation, changes in appointment are edited asap into text file in case some other user 
    tries to access it right after

    I tried to think in POV of patient/doctors and i think they would benefit more from hashtables organised by date:
    Patient choose available slot they want by date
    I also put doctor's confirmed slots by date because of convenience when viewing their scheudles
    
    I assume patients dont have as many appointments as the doctor so hashtable isnt as necessary for storing CONFIRMED appointment slots when it comes to patients


Other things outside of Doctor:
    Redundan appointments may build up, maybe could run something whenever we start the code in order to remove any empty appointment slots that have
    expired beyong todays date

    Also the Email Sender thing i have a problem where im not sure what to do after the doctor decline ur appointment
    like how is the patient evenm supp to find out they had their appointment rejected
    1. it seems unrealistic to notify by the code itself becus they wldnt visit the doctor so often
    so i think either:
    1.send Email
    2.send 'SMS'
    problem is idt it is vanilla java anymore, anyway somebody help pls

    I ended by straying away from my initial class diagram design so that has to be re done too D:

    Chnage password on initial login is a stated REQUIREMNT, MUST ADD 

    Also for view hospital staffs under Admin role, i think should add filter by bloodtype, becaus like its a hospital wut if they need blood then need a specific bloodtype u feel me 

Notes:
    im lowkey confused how tf to edit textfiles?? idt u can edit like a specific line in a text file easily
    so imma assume updating medical record does not mean editing but like adding to the text file

    Also im not sure which apporach to take for the list of overseeing patients of the doctor:
    currently im thinking whether to have it in patient as a attribute/list or
    create one list of overseeing patients for each doctor
    probably gonna ask somebody whether 1 patient gets overseen by > 1 doctor?? Idt its common? ive never been to the hospital guys-

    So im leaning towards 1 list for 1 doctor to record this, but im not sure how the doctor is supposed to edit their list of overseeing
    patients?? Or how do u usally define a doctor overseeing a patient??
    Isit like after 1 appointment he's my patient now or like he's my patient because he always comes to me to treatment
    becus if someone goes for consultation only its kinda weird to deem it as their 'overseeing patient' after only just 1 appointment
    Anyway lmk what u think 

    Precription still needs to be added into outcome record, im not sure what type hh is going for so i left it commented for now
    
    For the record, NONE of these codes hv been checked becus i cant run w stupid red
